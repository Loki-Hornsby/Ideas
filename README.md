# Overview
These are my ideas/projects, If you'd like to make/improve them yourself, go ahead. Credit (and an email showcasing it to me) would be nice to have but i understand some are selfish.

## Music Analysis
- [ ] [**Beat System**](https://github.com/Loki-Hornsby/Beat-System) : A system to analyse music
- [ ] **AMV Studio / AMV Game** : Similar to animated music videos, this animation studio would produce anime entirely in sync with a song (i.e gunshots hapening in time to a beat, bass drops leading the character to fall). The song itself would encompass the entire story. Art style would be similar to "Akira" and be set in a world similar to the futuristic dystopia conveyed in "Cyberpunk: Edgerunners". Checkout "Kaizo Trap by Guy Collins" (Originally i had the idea of making this concept in game form too with guns n' stuff and produced a bit of code for it but FFT, Onset detection, etc is hard and i lost interest after seeing kaizo trap already hit the idea on the head). "Animation paper" is a good bit of software to use for completing this task.
- [ ] **Pirate box** : A box used by sound engineers for gathering data on audio such as FFT, Onset detection, etc. It would have over the top animations on a small display and provide verbose data and also have the capacity to pirate music from online platform such as youtube alongside other functionalities like being able to plug into a radio and provide visuals for the music. It would also have its own website where users could buy and build it themselves (software included)

## Gamedev
- [ ] [**Unitilities**](https://github.com/Loki-Hornsby/Unitilities) : A useful class for storing unity functions
- [ ] [**Boomsatsuma Game**](https://github.com/Loki-Hornsby/The-Project) (Private) : A game for boomsatsuma college
- [ ] [**Trash Talk**](https://github.com/Loki-Hornsby/Brackeys-Game-Jam-2021.2) : A game where you shoot trash (Kinda like "Nuclear Throne")
- [ ] [**Ride Minecarts**](https://github.com/Loki-Hornsby/Ride-Minecart)
- [ ] [**Hoverboard**](https://github.com/Loki-Hornsby/Hoverboard)
- [ ] [**Universal Mod Engine**](https://github.com/Loki-Hornsby/Universal-Mod-Engine) : An engine to mod/patch into **Any** game.
- [ ] [**UME.Broforce**](https://github.com/Loki-Hornsby/UME.Broforce) : A mod interface for broforce using UME (**Universal mod engine**)

## General Applications
- [ ] [**Info-Creator**](https://github.com/Loki-Hornsby/Info-Creator) : Creates a text file detailing info about a folder.
- [ ] [**Youtube pirate**](https://github.com/Loki-Hornsby/Youtube-Video-Downloader) : Steals youtube videos üòè 
- [ ] [**RSTFTCL**](https://github.com/Loki-Hornsby/RSTFTCL) : A "Really Simple Tracker For The Command Line", Acts like a digital diary only for self improvement, analysis and exploration
- [ ] [**Score Counter**](https://github.com/Loki-Hornsby/Score-Counter) : Simple app for keeping score on multiple games 
- [ ] [**Change Log Tool**](https://github.com/Loki-Hornsby/Change-Log-Tool) : Creates Change logs quickly
- [ ] **Fixit** : An instagram style user interface for fixing issues of any kind, worldwide and nearby. From saving a cat from a tree, finding love or even fixing an entire car - paid work or free (with some food and drink provided of course) would allow the world to go around and maybe even land a homeless guy a job.
